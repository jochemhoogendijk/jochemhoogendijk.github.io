# Professional
## Research interest
My current research is on solving and deducing properties of first-order conservation partial differential equations by using random graphs and branching processes. This fits into my broader interest of representing/solving partial differential equations using stochastic processes. 


## Publications
Below you can find my preprints and publications.

### Preprints
- Branching process representation for Burgers-like nonlinear partial differential equations (with Ivan Kryven). [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11338)
- Higher order moments for SPDE with monotone nonlinearities (with Manuel Gnann and Mark Veraar). [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15307)



## Employment 
I am currently a third year PhD Student at Utrecht University. My supervisor is Dr. [Ivan Kryven](https://www.uu.nl/staff/IVKryven). Previously, I was a student in applied mathematics and applied physics at Delft University of Technology where I wrote my master's thesis under Prof. [Mark Veraar](https://fa.ewi.tudelft.nl/~veraar/) and Dr. [Manuel Gnann](https://sites.google.com/view/manuelgnannpersonalhomepage/home).

## Teaching
I have been involved as a student assistant in several courses:
- Mathematical statistical mechanics, masters course (2023/2024)
- Analysis, first year course (2022/2023)
- Calculus and linear algebra, first year course (2022/2023)
- Modelling with ODEs and PDEs, third year course (2022/2023)
- Statistics, second year course (2021/2022)
- Introduction to numerical analysis (2021/2022)
- Introduction to probability and statistics, first year course (2021)

## Tools
I think it is important in the digital age to be more open about the tools you use. There are a lot of great digital tools out there to make life easier for you, but you may not know about them! While most of my work as a mathematician still happens with pen and paper. I mostly use (and highly recommend!) the following tools:
- PARA method for information management. [Link](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)
- LaTeX in VSCode with VIM and Copilot plugins. For more, see the great blogs by [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and [Leandro Chiarni](https://www.lchiarini.com/vim/2022/05/28/Vim-for-mathematicians.html).
- Git during the writing process.
- Mathematica for most simple on-paper computations.

# Personal
If you are interested what I do or think outside of mathematics, please see below. I must admit though that much of my personal life also involves mathematics in some way or another.
## Interesting Articles
Once in a while I run into a fascinating article and may add it to the list below. I try to add articles that contain a good measure of surprise and new ideas. I think such articles are usually the most informing. 
- [How to do great work](http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html) (This is a long read!)

## Books
I have always liked reading both fiction and non-fiction. I recently finished Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson, a great read if you are into history, mathematics and cyber culture. My current book recommendation is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.

## Games
I have played a lot of videogames growing up and occasionally still do. I am not playing anything at the moment. My current game recommendation is Elden Ring.

## Movies
My current movie recommendation is Whiplash by Damien Chazelle.
