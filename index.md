# Professional
## Research interest
My current research is on solving and deducing properties of first-order conservation partial differential equations by using random graphs and branching processes (*A preprint on this will appear very soon*). This fits into my broader interest of representing/solving partial differential equations using stochastic processes. 


## Publications
Below you can find my preprints and publications.
- Higher order moments for SPDE with monotone nonlinearities [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15307)



## Employment 
I am currently a third year PhD Student at Utrecht University. My supervisor is Dr. [Ivan Kryven](https://www.uu.nl/staff/IVKryven). Previously, I was a student in applied mathematics and applied physics at Delft University of Technology where I wrote my master's thesis under Prof. [Mark Veraar](https://fa.ewi.tudelft.nl/~veraar/) and Dr. [Manuel Gnann](https://sites.google.com/view/manuelgnannpersonalhomepage/home).

## Teaching

# Personal
If you are interested what I do or think outside of mathematics, please see below. I must admit though that much of my personal life also involves mathematics in some way or another.
## Articles
Once in a while I run into a fascinating article and may add it to the list below. I try to add articles that contain a good measure of surprise and new ideas. I think such articles are usually the most informing. 
- [We shouldn't give classroom lectures anymore](https://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2023-24-3-145.pdf)
- [Being a noob](http://www.paulgraham.com/noob.html)

## Books
I have always liked reading both fiction and non-fiction. I am currently reading Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson. My current book recommendation is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.

## Games
I have played a lot of videogames growing up and occasionally still do. I am not playing anything at the moment. My current game recommendation is Elden Ring.

## Movies
My current movie recommendation is Whiplash by Damien Chazelle.
