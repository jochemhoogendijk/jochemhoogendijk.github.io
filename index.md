# Professional
## Research interest
My current research is on solving and deducing properties of first-order conservation partial differential equations by using random graphs and branching processes. This fits into my broader interest of representing/solving partial differential equations using stochastic processes. 


## Publications
Below you can find my preprints and publications.

### Publications
- Higher order moments for SPDE with monotone nonlinearities (with Manuel Gnann and Mark Veraar) - *Published in Stochastics* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1080/17442508.2024.2384554)
- Gelation and localization in multicomponent coagulation with multiplicative kernel through branching processes (with Ivan Kryven and Camillo Schenone) - *Published in the Journal of Statistical Physics* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10955-024-03301-z)

### Preprints
- A limit theorem for the total progeny distribution of multi-type branching processes (with Ivan Kryven and Rik Versendaal). [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22518)
- Branching process representation for Burgers-like nonlinear partial differential equations (with Ivan Kryven). [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11338)

## Employment 
I am currently a fourth year PhD Student at Utrecht University. My supervisor is Dr. [Ivan Kryven](https://www.uu.nl/staff/IVKryven). Previously, I was a student in applied mathematics and applied physics at Delft University of Technology where I wrote my master's thesis under Prof. [Mark Veraar](https://fa.ewi.tudelft.nl/~veraar/) and Dr. [Manuel Gnann](https://sites.google.com/view/manuelgnannpersonalhomepage/home).

## Teaching
I have been involved as a student assistant in several courses:
- Mathematical statistical mechanics, masters course (2023/2024, 2024/2025)
- Analysis, first year course (2022/2023, 2023/2024)
- Calculus and linear algebra, first year course (2022/2023)
- Modelling with ODEs and PDEs, third year course (2022/2023)
- Statistics, second year course (2021/2022)
- Introduction to numerical analysis (2021/2022)
- Introduction to probability and statistics, first year course (2021)

## Tools
There are a lot of great digital tools out there to make life easier for you, but you may not know about them! Hence, I list some of the tools I use below. While most of my work as a mathematician still happens with pen and paper, I mostly use (and highly recommend!) the following tools:
- PARA method for information management. [Link](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)
- LaTeX in VSCode with VIM and Copilot plugins. For more, see the great blogs by [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and [Leandro Chiarni](https://www.lchiarini.com/vim/2022/05/28/Vim-for-mathematicians.html).
- Git during the writing process. This is particularly useful if you are making big modifications to a paper and may want to go back a version. This can also be combined with Overleaf.
- Mathematica for most simple on-paper computations.
